        <p>In the Taíno language of the pre-Colombian Caribbean, itabo means a body of clear water.  This name represents our mission statement.  itabo seeks to bring transparency to the land market to help government agencies, businesses, and citizens make informed decisions regarding land and property.  Currently, critical stakeholders do not have the level of access to land data that the United States already has at its fingertips.  Based upon graduate-level research both in Jamaica and in broader land tenure studies, Keith Mantel (co-founder and CEO of itabo) created a solution to this problem.  In March, Keith will be presenting these findings at the annual World Bank conference on land and poverty. </p>
            <p>Economists accept that governance of public wealth is one of the crucial institutional building blocks that divides well run countries from fragile states.  This assertion is grounded in observations showing that governments and private citizens around the world have trillions of dollars of public assets that are often poorly managed and frequently unaccounted for on their balance sheets.  The term “dead capital” has been coined to describe assets which have value but are unable to be used (leveraged).  However, in recent decades, policymakers have focused almost solely on managing debt while largely ignoring the issue of public wealth. </p>
                <p>Zillow is the leader in the US for providing real estate related information and has 140 million unique visitors per month across all of its platforms.  However, the company has maintained that it has no plans for foreign expansion, focusing instead on internal US growth.  It is our contention that a Zillow-like model can and should be applied to transitioning global economies where property data is not readily available to the public in order to balance the information asymmetry that currently exists.  The key is to leverage the inherent value of the real estate market by selling advertising space on the itabo website and mobile application to those most connected to the land market: realtors, mortgage lenders, construction, insurance companies, and other land users. </p>
                    <p>Blending the skills of Keith (with an MBA     in Economics and Finance as well as Geospatial Information Systems) and the near decade of computer programming skills of co-founder and CTO, Anthony Dewstow, itabo is creating the leading real estate and home-related information marketplace in Jamaica to help people find vital information about homes, and connect with local professionals.  We are transforming the way people make home-related decisions, and enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to find and connect with local professionals best suited to meet their needs. </p>

             <h3>Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer</h3>

             <p>Keith has spent much of the last 10 years living and working abroad in post-conflict and underdeveloped regions of the world. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a BA in Government and International Development. Seeking opportunities in the foreign policy sphere, he joined US Army Intelligence and served for six years, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.  While in the military, Keith completed his MBA and also acquired skills in GIS, management, and data collection and analysis. Frustrated with military’s function in nation building, he decided to apply his skills elsewhere in global development.</p>
             <p>Focusing on land rights, he traveled to Myanmar, conducting research on land tenure disputes. He discovered that land also played a significant role in the stagnation of poverty reduction and political development. Keith is now completing his thesis for a Master’s of Science with the Technical University of Munich, on research conducted throughout 2015 in Jamaica.</p>
